# Project 2

This project is the chat between people in a chat room.
You can find different html files, and the application.py which is used to run the server, and that has the main functions to save the data required from the forms in each html, and to emit them as a message to everyone.

* register.html: Principal page for registration.
* new_user.html: This new_user page is just a bridge that will be showed until your user is created and the channels available load.
* index.html: In this page you can find the page where you can choose the channel you want and see the list of channels available.
* channels.html: This page shows you the channel you are in and the messages that are going to be send in it.
* exit.html: The exit.html page is part of the personal touch, which is that you can log out from this site.
